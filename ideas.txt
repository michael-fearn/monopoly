Board methods consume player

passGo(player) : gives player money
owned properties keep reference of their owner.

visitResidential(player): can buy / charges for parking

receiveChance/CommunityChest(player): applies effects that:

visitUtility(player): can buy / charges for parking
visitJail(player): can buy / charges for parking.
